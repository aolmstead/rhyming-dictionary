# rhyming-dictionary

This is a rhyming dictionary built using Python and the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

To do:
- break steps into functions for readability
- wrap file opening safely in a try/except
- allow simple editing of the word list and symbol/phoneme map
- create a web app
- improve performance (json?)
- maintain plug-and-play compatibility with the original CMU files
- add the ability for rhymes to be found in the middle of words or phrases, e.g. a perfect rhyme spread between two words
- add a thesaurus function (roget's?)
